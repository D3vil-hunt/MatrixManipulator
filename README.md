# MatrixManipulator

This is just an experiment for fun. It performs various fundamental operations on matrices. The main objective of this project is to
develop a scaleable program whic can perform elementary matrix operations eg: adding, multiplying, dividing & substracting two matrices
finding inverse of a matrix etc.

There are two halves of this project one that deals with the matrix manipulation and the other is for the data input. The input can be provided
in two ways first is to spicify a matrix and perform operations on it like adjoint, inverse, etc. Other way is to input an expression such
"a+b*c" where a, b and c are matrices after entering the expression the application should ask to input data of matrics and operate on it 
as specified by the expression.

The the equation functionality is lacking and is under development. Further this project can be extend to mabe a gui solution or maybe ported 
to an andriod app for students. possibilities are infinite.

Just some tips:

1- please use comments extensively for defining every function.

2- if added there should an elaborative description of class.

3- Deletion id not allowed!

4- feel free to modify.

Happy contibuting.
